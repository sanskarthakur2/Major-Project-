• Title : 

o “Arduino-based Dual-axis Solar Tracker for Efficient Solar Energy 

Harvesting” 

• Objective/Aim : 

o Primary Objective:

Design and implement an Arduino-based solar tracker that maximizes solar 

panel efficiency by tracking the sun’s movement.

o Specific Aims: o Increase solar energy output by adjusting panel 

orientation. o Automate the tracking process using sensors and actuators. 

o Develop a cost-effective and scalable solution. 

• Project description: 

This project presents an open hardware/software test bench for solar tracker. The 

proposed prototype is based on a dual-axis solar tracker controlled with Arduino 

Uno which is an open-source prototyping platform based on easy-to-use 

hardware and software. The solar tracker can be controlled automatically with 

the help of Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) sensors or manually using a 

potentiometer. Moreover, this test bench provides virtual instrumentation based 

on Excel in which its solar tracker data can be recorded and presented. The 

hardware used has been chosen to be inexpensive, compact and versatile. The 

proposed test bench is designed to help students develop their understanding of 

control theory and their application. 

It is based on a solar tracker that can rotate automatically to track the sun with 

the help of four LDR sensors and two servomotors (SM1 and SM2), or manually 

using a potentiometer. To switch between the two modes (automatic and 

manual), a pushbutton is used. Another push-button is used to link either the 

SM1(up-down servomotor) or SM2 (left-right servomotor) to the potentiometer 

to control their movement. Moreover, a computer is used as a virtual instrument 

to visualize the mode and current, voltage and power of the PV panel according 

to time in MS Excel. Arduino Uno board is utilized to implement all software
